In this machine learning project, we would be predicting the genre of the app released based on a few features such as the location, time and date released respectively. Moreover, data visualization was performed to give us a good understanding of some features present in data. Various barplots were generated to get us a good understanding of data respectively. We would be looking forward to understand the genre of various applications.  

## Directions to run the Ipython notebook 

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
2. Once "Git" is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to download this repository.  
3. If you have successfully installed Git, you'll get an option called "Gitbash Here" when you right-click on a particular location. 
4. Once the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then paste the link of the repository. 
5. The link of the repository can be found when you click on "Code" (Green button) and then, there would be a html link just below. Therefore, the command to download a particular repository should be "Git clone html" where the html is replaced by the link to this repository. 
6. Once downloaded, you might use the jupyter notebook to run the .ipynb files or other navigators to open this file.

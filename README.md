In this machine learning project, we would be predicting the genre of the app released based on a few features such as the location, time and date released respectively. Moreover, data visualization was performed to give us a good understanding of some features present in data. Various barplots were generated to get us a good understanding of data respectively. We would be looking forward to understand the genre of various applications.  

## Directions to run the Ipython notebook 

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
2. Once the Git is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to add the files or the repository. 
3. You'll have to click on "Gitbash here" that would be opened when you right click on a particular location. 
4. One the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then copy the clipboard file that is present when you click on Code in Github. The link must be pasted and run so that the files would be downloaded at the location of interest. 
5. Later, you'll need to use Anaconda Prompt and add "Jupyter notebook" in the prompt. 
6. This would open the jupyter notebook that could be used to run and load the .ipynb files respectively. Therefore, you would be able to run the project at hand.
